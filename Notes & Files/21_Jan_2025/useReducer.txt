useReducer:
Same as useState to manage or update states that is data that is valuesof components.
Difference is if u have more states or complex things u use useReducer hook

Step1:
Crete increment decrement program using useState

step2:
replace useState with useReducer

Point 1 :
    useReducer takes 2 args first is reducer function and second is initial state
Point 2 :
    useReducer return array with 2 values first is state and second is dispatch function


Here state will hold the intital value and updated once u call dispatch function 

And dispatch will trigger the reducer function to update the state
