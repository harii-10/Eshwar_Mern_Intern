Promise Inbuilt Methods : 
		
		-> When there is more that one promise on order to review them we can use promise in built methods according to the requirements 

		1) Promise.all          => Once it sees a promise false it will stop

		2) Promise.any          => Gives According to the time (shortest time). Shorter time promise provided, status 							   should be true

		3) Promise.allsettled   => 
		                          1) Fullfilled
		                          2) Rejected
		                          3) Pending

		4) Promise.race         => Unlike Any Race will work even with the False (ie : If false it returns the reject, 							   whereas in "any" is it false it return the next smallest promise )
